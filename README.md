# Basic-Classes-Single-Inheritance
Create a Class. Each developed class should, as a rule, contain the following elements: private fields, constructors with and without parameters, methods, and properties. The methods and properties should provide a consistent, complete, minimal, and convenient class interface. Exceptions should be thrown in case of errors. The program should test all developed elements of the class.
Create a Derived Class.
